#Read in all chim1 ASV tables as RDS files, and
#combine all plates run through the dada2 pipeline, and then filter them to remove 
#low abundance reads, using the threshold of keeping only ASVs with >0.0001% per sample. 
#Then run the collapse no mismatch step on the combined ASVs tables.
#The collapse no mismatch step will compare reads and collapse any reads that are 100% identical
#into one read, using the more dominant of the two collapsed ASVs as the final ASV and adding their abundances.
